# Diabetes Risk Assessment Using Logistic Regression
This repository contains code and documentation for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on various risk factors using logistic regression analysis.

Overview
Diabetes is a chronic health condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can lead to various complications if left untreated. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing complications and improving patient outcomes. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on a set of risk factors including age, blood glucose level, BMI, and HbA1c level.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle (link: Diabetes Prediction), containing a comprehensive set of features associated with diabetes risk factors. Each record in the dataset includes information such as blood sugar levels, body mass index (BMI), age, family history, and other relevant health indicators, along with a diagnosis label indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not.

Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We explore the dataset to understand the distribution of various risk factors including gender, age, blood glucose level, BMI, and HbA1c level.

Logistic Regression Analysis: We apply logistic regression analysis to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the provided risk factors. The model is interpreted to understand the impact of each risk factor on diabetes risk, and hypothesis testing is performed to assess the significance of predictor variables.

Conclusion
Our analysis reveals that age, blood glucose level, BMI, and HbA1c level exhibit statistically significant effects on the likelihood of diabetes. These findings provide valuable insights into diabetes risk assessment, highlighting the importance of early detection and management strategies.
